					<h2>Black Friday</h2>
					<h3><p id="testP" class="funParagraph">So after about a week of processing & medical I was assigned to Bravo Company 1034. We arrived in the squadbay sitting 
                  on the floor in a formatted position. You can hear everyones hearts pounding. Then five drill instructors and an officer came out and recited their creed
                  in front of us. After that lockers were pushed, seabags emptied in the middle of the squadbay. Spit, screaming, crying, and exhaustion pretty much summed up
                  the day. In terms of the Marines I got smoked(physical training). I think by the end i needed to go to medical. 
               </p></h3>

					<h2>(LET THE GAMES BEGIN)</h2>
					<h3><p>Let's kickoff firsphase. First Phase you were stripped to the bare minimum. Unbloused boots, unrolled sleeves, looking like rolled up brown bag of lunch.
                  Most of the time we spent drilling with rifles, getting smoked because we didn't do something right, even the weakest became strong. We even counted the next chow 
                  just to count the days until we graduated. We were next to the San Diego International Airport which made life miserable, every flight was our flight out.
               </p></h3>

					<h2>THE CRUCIBLE(THE REAPER) & GRADUATION</h2>
					<h3><p>To Sum Up we went through rifle range, sleepless nights for a week & the crucible. The crucible were a series of challenges to test 
                  your survival skills & team skills to the max. These were tough it even included a mountain called the reaper. After this there was a hump back and a
                  warrior breakfast. After a tough and strenous 3 months we graduated bootcamp and earned the title Marine. The best part was recieving our EGA in front of everyone.
               </p></h3>
